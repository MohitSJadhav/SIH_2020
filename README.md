The system makes the captcha authentication process reliable for the
visually impaired as well as normal users. The said system makes use of
audio captcha in user preferred language, where the provided audio
instruction is based on the general knowledge of shapes of the user. The
instructed task is needed to be performed on the canvas by the user in
specified time limit. If the instructed task is completed successfully within
the specified time the access is granted else the new captcha is provided
to the user until the maximum attempt limit is reached. On reaching
maximum attempt limit the user is redirected to the previous page.

The said system will use audio and image visualization. An inactive canvas
will pop up covering the maximum browser window. Then the user has to speak
out the languageâ€™s name of his/her choice in order to select preferred language of
audio instruction for captcha. Audio instruction will contain noise for security
purpose. Now the user will be instructed to perform the operation(s) on the
active canvas as specified in the audio instruction. The task performed by the user
will be auto submitted when the timer ends. If the user is able to perform the task
of the audio instruction correctly within the given time constraints, the system
will authenticate user and further access will be granted. If user fails to perform
the instructed task correctly, user will be provided with a new captcha with
initially preferred language until the user performs instructed task correctly or the
user reaches the maximum attempt limit else the authentication process fails and
user will be redirected to previous page.
